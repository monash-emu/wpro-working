    "\n",
    "This is a standard \"semi-mechanistic\" or \"renewal\" modelling approach,\n",
    "in that the population is not explicitly partitioned into categories or compartments.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, ignoring strains, we'll consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "$i_t = (1-\\frac{n_t}{N})R_t\\sum_{\\tau<t} i_{\\tau}g_{t-\\tau}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is essentially the same as the equation provided by [Cori, et al.](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/178/9/1505/89262?login=true):\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{E}[I_t] = R_t\\sum_{s=1}^t I_{t-s}w_s$\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we'll also ignore susceptible depletion and a varying reproduction number, and so consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "$i_t = R_0\\sum_{\\tau<t} i_\\tau g_{t-\\tau}$\n",

    "This notebook builds up this basic approach very slowly as an illustration of what we will be doing in the analysis notebook."
